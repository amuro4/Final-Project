# Final Project: Statistical Analysis and Shiny App Development

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing the `palmerpenguins` dataset using R and building an interactive Shiny app. Key objectives include:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- K-means Clustering
- Predictive Model Building

## Deliverables
1. **Shiny App**: An interactive interface to explore, analyze, and visualize data.
2. **RMarkdown Document**: Includes EDA, PCA, and clustering analysis.
3. **GitHub Repository**: Contains all scripts, datasets, and instructions.

## Key Features of the Shiny App
- Dataset exploration and visualization tools.
- Model building and evaluation.
- Interactive PCA and clustering visualizations.
- Options to save plots and download results.

## Next Steps
- Perform initial data exploration.
- Handle missing values and conduct detailed EDA.
- Develop and deploy the Shiny app.
